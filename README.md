##ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

My name is Felipe, I'm Brazilian and I'm 34 years old. I've been immersed in the world of programming since I was 12 years old.

I'm passionate about developing web/mobile applications.

I'm an expert in React, NextJS, Expo, Javascript, Typescript, HTML and CSS.

I've developed over 400 websites throughout my 22-year journey as a programmer, working on several large and important projects.

I currently work at Liqi Digital Assets, where I've been since the company was founded and where I've worked on the tokenization platform, cryptocurrency brokerage, design system development, and front-end technology direction.
